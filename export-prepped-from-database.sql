-- This script creates the files needed by `Network_Clean.py`, drawing
-- upon the ORMA–VN database and schema
-- Specifically: `Original_Intervals.csv`, `Original_Points.csv`, and `Adj_lines.csv`

-- So, instead of building a network form a directory of RoadLabPro runs,
-- you could build one from the ORMA–VN database

-- Pass the first two digits of the VPRoMMS road IDs in as `province_code`,
-- eg, `psql ${DATABASE_URL} -f export-prepped-from-database.sql -v province_code=02`
-- Alternatively, run with `-v province_code=` to capture all roads that
-- have non-null VPRoMMS road IDs
